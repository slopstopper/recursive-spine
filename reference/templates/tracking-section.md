## Tracking (recursive-spine convention)

Work state lives in GitHub issues and milestones, not in prose files.
- What's in flight: `gh issue list --assignee @me`
- Deferred work: `gh issue list --label <DEFERRAL_LABEL>`
- Branches: `<prefix>/<issue>-<slug>`; PRs say `Closes #N`.
- Deferral requires a filed issue. Handover files its debts before closing.
