  # any line (after leading whitespace) of 3+ identical backticks or
  # tildes; a fence only CLOSES on a line of the SAME character with a
  # run length >= the opening run (a shorter or differently-charactered
  # fence-looking line inside is just content — this stops a stray fence
  # from silently swallowing every later marker in the file). If EOF is
  # reached still inside a fence, emit an UNCLOSED sentinel so the shell
  # loop can note it loudly instead of silently dropping later markers.
